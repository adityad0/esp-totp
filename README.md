# ESP-TOTP

## About

The ESP-TOTP is a Time-based one-time password (TOTP) generator written in Python (CircuitPython) for the SEEED XIAO ESP32-C3. TOTP is an extension for HMAC-based one-time passwords (HOTP). TOTPs are generated at regular intervals, have a fixed length and change with time. They can be generated offline, unlike traditional OTPs and eliminate the need for an active internet or mobile connection.

## Components
1. A microcontroller such as the SEEED XIAO ESP32-C3
2. SSD1306 OLED display
3. Rotary encoder
4. Wires
5. Li-ion battery

## Getting started

## Program description

## Future updates
1. An app to connect to the device over Bluetooth/Wi-Fi to add new TOTP secrets and sync time.
